## Synopsis

Project to create an English measurements version of the PHASTEx tool. PHASTEx is a spreadsheet that helps users survey all process heating equipment within a facility, select the equipment that uses the most energy, and identify ways to increase efficiency.

## Code Example

PHASTEx serves three purposes.
1.  Provides easy-to-use tools to calculate the potential savings that a plant can achieve by applying various energy-saving measures.
2.  Surveys all equipment that uses fuel, steam, or electricity for heating. Based on facility-specific heat input and furnace operating data, the tool reports how much fuel, electricity, and steam each piece of equipment uses annuallyâ€”plus the estimated annual energy costs.
3.  Constructs a detailed heat balance for selected pieces of process heating equipment. Results of the heat balance pinpoint areas of the equipment in which energy is wasted or used unproductively.
## Motivation

This project allows for the enhancement of the existing version by providing additional units of measurement.

## Installation

Download and use Microsoft Excel to open the spreadsheet.
